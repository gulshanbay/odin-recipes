            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Tomatos</li>

            <li>Kurkuma, salt, pepper for seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Cut the chicken into medium sized pieces. (Refer to the photo above)</li>
            <li>Slice onions in half moon shape. That is, cut in half and the slice from one side to the other, not from top to buttom.</li>
            <li>Dice the tomatos.</li>
            <li>Dice coriander into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li>Wisk the eggs later when everything is cooked.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add butter to a wide and not very tall pan, put it on a medium to high temperature.</li>
            <li>When the butter is melted and hot add chopped chicken pieces, cook until its juice released and vaporized.</li>
            <li>Add sliced onions and cover its lid to be cooked. It is an eastern dish, so don't be afraid to add more butter if necessary. Here you should reduce the heat a bit and mix them every now and then, so that they all get cooked better.</li>
            <li>When you see onions turning to almost golden color, add a teaspoon or so of kurkuma, mix and then add tomatos.</li>
            <li>As soon as tomatos are cooked season for your taste add wisked eggs, 2 or 3, as you might wish, or just skip this step altogether.</li>
            <li>Decorate with coriander when serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Make sure not to overcook eggs, they should be more on the soft side rather than spongy. Also, if things are cooked but there is a lot of water you can keep the lid open. It should turn out to be a nice golden color not gloomy grayish.</p>
